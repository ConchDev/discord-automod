# discord-automod
A simple Discord automod with Anti-Raid and Anti-Spam features

## Contributing
To contribute, simply fork the repository and make a pull request! I'm not too picky. In the future, workflows and utilities such as pre-commit
and linter requirements may be added, but at the moment the project is young so any help is appreciated!

Check out the [Project](https://github.com/users/ConchDev/projects/1) to see what needs to be done!
